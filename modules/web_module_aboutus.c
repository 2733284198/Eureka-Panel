    printf("Team Eureka was founded early in November of 2013 by ddggttff3, kyonz, and tchebb, three of the main contributors to XDA-Developers' Chromecast community. Our objective is to make the Chromecast an open and extensible device, free from Google's restrictive whitelisting. Our current projects allow rooted Chromecasts to bypass the whitelist and location restrictions imposed by content providers (Thanks Obama!), and we're working hard to unlock more of the Chromecast's full potential.<br /><br />\n");
    printf("Together, our members' unique skills allow us to develop for the Chromecast on all levels, from frontend design to low-level vulnerability research and anywhere in between. We hope that you're as excited as we are about our current projects, and we look forward to showing you what's still to come.<br /><br />\n");
